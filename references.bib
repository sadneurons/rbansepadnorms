   abstract = {We evaluated the performance of CSF biomarkers for predicting risk of clinical decline and conversion to dementia in non-demented patients with cognitive symptoms. CSF samples from patients in two multicentre longitudinal studies (ADNI, n = 619; BioFINDER, n = 431) were analysed. Abeta(1-42), tTau and pTau CSF concentrations were measured using Elecsys CSF immunoassays, and tTau/Abeta(1-42) and pTau/Abeta(1-42) ratios calculated. Patients were classified as biomarker (BM)-positive or BM-negative at baseline. Ability of biomarkers to predict risk of clinical decline and conversion to AD/dementia was assessed using pre-established cut-offs for Abeta(1-42) and ratios; tTau and pTau cut-offs were determined. BM-positive patients showed greater clinical decline than BM-negative patients, demonstrated by greater decreases in MMSE scores (all biomarkers: -2.10 to -0.70). Risk of conversion to AD/dementia was higher in BM-positive patients (HR: 1.67 to 11.48). Performance of Tau/Abeta(1-42) ratios was superior to single biomarkers, and consistent even when using cut-offs derived in a different cohort. Optimal pTau and tTau cut-offs were approximately 27 pg/mL and 300 pg/mL in both BioFINDER and ADNI. Elecsys pTau/Abeta(1-42) and tTau/Abeta(1-42) are robust biomarkers for predicting risk of clinical decline and conversion to dementia in non-demented patients, and may support AD diagnosis in clinical practice.},

Summary: This highly anticipated second edition features new chapters and sections, 225 new references, and comprehensive R software. In keeping with the previous edition, this book is about the art and science of data analysis and predictive modeling, which entails choosing and using multiple tools. Instead of presenting isolated techniques, this text emphasizes problem solving strategies that address the many issues arising when developing multivariable models using real data and not standard textbook examples. It includes imputation methods for dealing with missing data effectively, methods for fitting nonlinear relationships and for making the estimation of transformations a formal part of the modeling process, methods for dealing with "too many variables to analyze and not enough observations," and powerful model validation techniques based on the bootstrap.  The reader will gain a keen understanding of predictive accuracy, and the harm of categorizing continuous predictors or outcomes.  This text realistically deals with model uncertainty, and its effects on inference, to achieve "safe data mining." It also presents many graphical methods for communicating complex regression models to non-statisticians. Regression Modeling Strategies presents full-scale case studies of non-trivial datasets instead of over-simplified illustrations of each method. These case studies use freely available R functions that make the multiple imputation, model building, validation, and interpretation tasks described in the book relatively easy to do. Most of the methods in this text apply to all regression models, but special emphasis is given to multiple regression using generalized least squares for longitudinal data, the binary logistic model, models for ordinal responses, parametric survival regression models, and the Cox semiparametric survival model.  A new emphasis is given to the robust analysis of continuous dependent variables using ordinal regression. As in the first edition, this text is intended for Masters' or Ph.D. level graduate students who have had a general introductory probability and statistics course and who are well versed in ordinary multiple regression and intermediate algebra. The book will also serve as a reference for data analysts and statistical methodologists, as it contains an up-to-date survey and bibliography of modern statistical modeling techniques. Examples used in the text mostly come from biomedical research, but the methods are applicable anywhere predictive models ("analytics") are useful, including economics, epidemiology, sociology, psychology, engineering, and marketing.},

   abstract = {It is common to present multiple adjusted effect estimates from a single model in a single table. For example, a table might show odds ratios for one or more exposures and also for several confounders from a single logistic regression. This can lead to mistaken interpretations of these estimates. We use causal diagrams to display the sources of the problems. Presentation of exposure and confounder effect estimates from a single model may lead to several interpretative difficulties, inviting confusion of direct-effect estimates with total-effect estimates for covariates in the model. These effect estimates may also be confounded even though the effect estimate for the main exposure is not confounded. Interpretation of these effect estimates is further complicated by heterogeneity (variation, modification) of the exposure effect measure across covariate levels. We offer suggestions to limit potential misunderstandings when multiple effect estimates are presented, including precise distinction between total and direct effect measures from a single model, and use of multiple models tailored to yield total-effect estimates for covariates.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: We classified non-demented European Prevention of Alzheimer's Dementia (EPAD) participants through the amyloid/tau/neurodegeneration (ATN) scheme and assessed their neuropsychological and imaging profiles. MATERIALS AND METHODS: From 1500 EPAD participants, 312 were excluded. Cerebrospinal fluid cut-offs of 1000 pg/mL for amyloid beta (Ass)1-42 and 27 pg/mL for p-tau181 were validated using Gaussian mixture models. Given strong correlation of p-tau and t-tau (R(2) = 0.98, P < 0.001), neurodegeneration was defined by age-adjusted hippocampal volume. Multinomial regressions were used to test whether neuropsychological tests and regional brain volumes could distinguish ATN stages. RESULTS: Age was 65 +/- 7 years, with 58% females and 38% apolipoprotein E (APOE) epsilon4 carriers; 57.1% were A-T-N-, 32.5% were in the Alzheimer's disease (AD) continuum, and 10.4% suspected non-Alzheimer's pathology. Age and cerebrovascular burden progressed with biomarker positivity (P < 0.001). Cognitive dysfunction appeared with T+. Paradoxically higher regional gray matter volumes were observed in A+T-N- compared to A-T-N- (P < 0.001). DISCUSSION: In non-demented individuals along the AD continuum, p-tau drives cognitive dysfunction. Memory and language domains are affected in the earliest stages.},

It recently has been demonstrated, however, that certain indices of the measure are susceptible to educational influences (Lineweaver, Zone, Chelune, Hermann, & Dow, 2001). The present investigation examined the effects of age and education on the six RBANS indices in a sample of nondemented older adults. Education accounted for a statistically significant proportion of the variance across all RBANS indices for this group (range=1.9-7.6%), while age increased the variance accounted for on four of six indices (range=0.5-2.2%). Regression-based educational corrections for index scores were derived to allow for appropriate adjustment. Effects of age, although statistically significant, were too small to make clinical adjustment on three of the four index scores worthwhile. On the Delayed Memory Index, however, correction for age for persons 80 years old and higher should be considered.},

   abstract = {Given considerable variation in diagnostic and therapeutic practice, there is a need for national guidance on the use of neuroimaging, fluid biomarkers, cognitive testing, follow-up and diagnostic terminology in mild cognitive impairment (MCI). MCI is a heterogenous clinical syndrome reflecting a change in cognitive function and deficits on neuropsychological testing but relatively intact activities of daily living. MCI is a risk state for further cognitive and functional decline with 5-15% of people developing dementia per year. However, ~50% remain stable at 5 years and in a minority, symptoms resolve over time. There is considerable debate about whether MCI is a useful clinical diagnosis, or whether the use of the term prevents proper inquiry (by history, examination and investigations) into underlying causes of cognitive symptoms, which can include prodromal neurodegenerative disease, other physical or psychiatric illness, or combinations thereof. Cognitive testing, neuroimaging and fluid biomarkers can improve the sensitivity and specificity of aetiological diagnosis, with growing evidence that these may also help guide prognosis. Diagnostic criteria allow for a diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease to be made where MCI is accompanied by appropriate biomarker changes, but in practice, such biomarkers are not available in routine clinical practice in the UK. This would change if disease-modifying therapies became available and required a definitive diagnosis but would present major challenges to the National Health Service and similar health systems. Significantly increased investment would be required in training, infrastructure and provision of fluid biomarkers and neuroimaging. Statistical techniques combining markers may provide greater sensitivity and specificity than any single disease marker but their practical usefulness will depend on large-scale studies to ensure ecological validity and that multiple measures, e.g. both cognitive tests and biomarkers, are widely available for clinical use. To perform such large studies, we must increase research participation amongst those with MCI.},

   abstract = {Neuropsychological assessment of older individuals with dementing illnesses has suffered from a lack of appropriately designed test instruments. The Repeatable Battery for the Assessment of Neuropsychological Status (RBANS) was developed for the dual purposes of identifying and characterizing abnormal cognitive decline in the older adult and as a neuropsychological screening battery for younger patients. The entire battery takes less than 30 minutes to administer, and yields scaled scores for five cognitive domains. The current study reports preliminary clinical validity results with the RBANS, comparing very mildly demented patients with a diagnosis of probable Alzheimer's disease (n = 20) to patients with Huntington's disease (n = 20) and normal controls (n = 40). Although the patient groups had essentially identical total scores on the RBANS, they exhibited opposite profiles, differing significantly on four of the five subsections. The AD patients performed most poorly on Language, and Delayed Memory subsections, while the HD patients obtained their lowest scaled scores on the Attention and the Visuospatial/Constructional subsections. These results are consistent with the neuropsychological profiles of these dementing disorders derived from lengthier standardized tests and experimental investigations. In addition, even those patients who performed above the suggested cut-off points on the MMSE and the Dementia Rating Scale scored significantly below their controls on the RBANS. These data suggest that the RBANS is effective at both detecting and characterizing dementia of different etiologies.},

Participants are recruited mainly from existing parent cohorts across Europe to form a {\textquoteleft}probability-spectrum{\textquoteright} population covering the entire continuum of anticipated probability for Alzheimer{\textquoteright}s dementia development. The primary objective of the EPAD LCS is to be a readiness cohort for the EPAD PoC trial though a second major objective is to generate a comprehensive and large data set for disease modelling of preclinical and prodromal Alzheimer{\textquoteright}s disease. This characterisation of cognitive, biomarker and risk factor (genetic and environmental) status of research participants over time will provide the necessary well-phenotyped population for developing accurate longitudinal models for Alzheimer{\textquoteright}s disease covering the entire disease course and concurrently create a pool of highly characterised individuals for the EPAD PoC trial.Ethics and dissemination The study has received the relevant approvals from numerous Institutional Review Boards across Europe. Findings will be disseminated to several target audiences, including the scientific community, research participants, patient community, general public, industry, regulatory authorities and policy-makers. Regular and coordinated releases of EPAD LCS data will be made available for analysis to help researchers improve their understanding of early Alzheimer{\textquoteright}s disease stages and facilitate collaborations.Trial registration number NCT02804789.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVE: The Repeatable Battery for the Assessment of Neuropsychological Status (RBANS) has been shown to be an effective screener for detecting neurocognitive impairments in English speaking forensic psychiatric inpatients, but no studies have examined whether the RBANS would have the same utility among monolingual Spanish speaking inpatients. This study sought to examine RBANS performance, as well as risk factors (i.e., educational, neurological, and medical) influencing RBANS performance, in that particular population. METHOD: The present study examined archival data collected from monolingual Spanish speaking inpatients (n = 34; mean age = 48.71, SD = 11.99; 85.3% men; 93.5% with Schizophrenia Spectrum Disorder). All participants must have RBANS data, and must not have a diagnosis of malingering or major neurocognitive disorder. Medical records of eligible participants were examined. RESULTS: Our findings indicated that most participants (75.8%) performed in the impaired range for the RBANS Total Index; however, the frequency of impaired performances varied on more specific RBANS indices (42.4%-72.7% of the participants). Although neurological and medical risk factors were not associated with RBANS Total Index performance (all p's = .26-.82), years of education appeared to be inversely associated with RBANS Total Index score (all p's = .04-.07). CONCLUSIONS: These findings can serve as the first step in helping to define "normative" cognition among Spanish speaking forensic psychiatric inpatients. Such findings can reduce the likelihood of over-pathologizing performance and increase the likelihood that treatment goals will be better tailored to the patient's cognitive ability.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Due to factors including differences in educational opportunity, African Americans and Caucasians frequently differ on cognitive tests creating diagnostic error risks. Such differences have been found on the Repeatable Battery for the Assessment of Neuropsychological Status (RBANS), and preliminary norms based on a small sample of African Americans have been generated. In a larger sample of community-dwelling older African Americans, we explored sources of variance including age, gender, common medical conditions, years of education, and reading level to generate norms stratified on the most relevant bases. METHOD: Three hundred and fifty-five African Americans aged 55+ and living independently completed the RBANS and health, education, and psychosocial interviews. RESULTS: Hypertension and type 2 diabetes were unrelated to overall RBANS performance once age and education were accounted for. Age, education, and WRAT-3 Reading score (a proxy for scholastic attainment) were independent predictors of RBANS performance. Females performed better on List Learning, Story Memory, Fluency, Coding, List Recall, and List Recognition; males were superior on Line Orientation and Picture Naming. CONCLUSIONS: In addition to generating norms stratified by age, we provide descriptive statistics grouped by age and education, and by age and WRAT-3 Reading grade level, to provide clinicians with the opportunity to tailor their interpretation of scores based upon perceived best fit for their patient. Regression formulas are provided to address gender differences. To complement the standard index norms, we provide norms for alternative indexes representing additional an factor structure of cognitive domains.},

This study investigated a large (n = 260) and diverse sample of patients at a forensic state psychiatric hospital. A substantial proportion (35.8%) of the sample performed two standard deviations below the normative mean on the Repeatable Battery for the Assessment of Neuropsychological Status (RBANS). In addition, 65% of the participants reported a history of developmental delays, less than 12 years of education, or past learning difficulties. Participants who reported these developmental and academic problems performed worse on the RBANS compared with those without such a history. Additionally, the more developmental/educational risk factors a participant reported, the more likely they were to be impaired on the RBANS. Half of the sample reported a history of at least one neurological risk factor (e.g., history of head injury with loss of consciousness). However, in this sample, a history of neurological risk factors did not influence overall performance on the RBANS and did not increase the likelihood of impairment. These results speak to the relevance of neuropsychological services at state psychiatric hospitals and provide some evidence that a history of developmental or academic problems may help identify psychiatric patients with neuropsychological compromise.},

Patients were classified as providing suspect effort (n = 45) or probable good effort (n = 258) using the TOMM and clinical consensus. Following the methodology of Silverberg and colleagues (2007), selected individual subtests and a summary Effort Index were evaluated. Setting specificity at approximately 85% yielded cut-offs of <15 on List Recognition, <8 on Digit Span, and >3 on the Effort Index. The modest sensitivity (51.1-64.4%) suggests that the indices should be used in conjunction with additional effort measures. In addition, the RBANS Picture Naming subtest was examined and showed modest sensitivity to detect suboptimal effort, but did not show notable incremental validity for detecting suboptimal effort beyond the Effort Index.},

Seventy per cent of patients with PFTBI received a neuropsychological classification between the "extremely low" and "low average" ranges. Group-wise analyses on the RBANS indices indicated that patients with PFTBI had the lowest (Immediate Memory, Attention, Delayed Memory, Total Score), or equal lowest (visuospatial, equivalent with schizophrenia patients) scores, with the exception of the Language Index where no group differences were shown (however, the mean PFTBI score on the Language Index was two standard deviations below the RBANS normative score).

   abstract = {Within the inpatient forensic setting, requests for a neuropsychological evaluation are common to determine cognitive strengths and weaknesses. However, variable effort proves to be a prominent issue in this setting. Thus, assessment of effort becomes an essential component of a neuropsychological evaluation. The California Verbal Learning Test, 2nd Edition (CVLT-II) and the Repeatable Battery for the Assessment of Neuropsychological Status (RBANS) are widely utilized cognitive measures in the inpatient setting. The purpose of this study is to establish the local base rates and predictive abilities of the CVLT-II Forced-Choice Recognition (FCR) measure and RBANS Effort Index (EI). Participants included 56 and 595 forensically-committed, psychotic-disordered inpatients who completed the CVLT-II FCR and RBANS EI, respectively. Results indicated that the estimated local base rate for a positive CVLT-II FCR score was 8%, which resulted in 97% negative predictive power and 50% positive predictive power. The estimated local base rate for a positive RBANS EI score was 16%, which resulted in 91.7% negative predictive power and 57.1% positive predictive power. Given their low sensitivity and predictive power, the results suggest that much more confidence can be placed in negative FCR and EI results as opposed to positive findings.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Mild cognitive impairment (MCI) represents an intermediate state between normal cognition and dementia. Early detection and treatment of reversible contributing factors to progressive cognitive decline currently forms the cornerstone of management. As the population at risk of developing dementia is projected to increase significantly in many low- and middle-income countries where health care services continue to operate under clinical and human resource constraints, there is a need for low-cost, quick and reliable screening tools. The Montreal cognitive assessment (MoCA) was developed as a brief screening tool with high sensitivity and specificity for detecting MCI. The initial validation sample for the MoCA consisted of English and French speaking Canadians. Studies undertaken in a variety of countries show that the reliability and validity of the MoCA in screening for MCI is good; however, it has been recommended that some item modification and adjustment of cut-offs for the diagnosis of MCI in these populations may be needed to account for cultural differences.To date, no studies have evaluated the MoCA in the South African population. We aimed to compare the validity of the MoCA to the RBANS, evaluate the effectiveness of the MoCA as a screening tool for MCI and generate normative data for the MoCA. METHODS: A cross-sectional observational study comprising a sample of 370 cognitively healthy males and females aged 18 years and older of mixed race (Coloured ethnicity) who were administered the MoCA and RBANS during screening. RESULTS: The MoCA showed acceptable internal consistency (Cronbach's alpha of 0.624). MoCA scores were significantly associated with gender (r = -0.199, p = 0.000), and correlated with age (r = -0.203, p = 0.000) and education (r = 0.326, p = 0.000). There was a strong correlation between total scores on the MoCA and RBANS (r = 513; p = 0.000), indicating good criterion-related validity. The MoCA also showed good agreement with the RBANS according to the Bland-Altman plot. ROC statistics demonstrated that the performance of the MoCA for predicting MCI compared to the RBANS was fair with an AUC of 0.794. Using the recommended cut-off score of 26, the MoCA showed high sensitivity (94.23%) but low specificity (28.16%). When the cut-off score was lowered to 23, the sensitivity was 75% and specificity 66.77%, while a cut-off of 24 demonstrated a sensitivity of 84.62% and a specificity of 52.53%. CONCLUSION: Although the MoCA appears fairly reliable at identifying MCI in this population, our findings suggest that some modification to certain domains and items is needed to improve the differentiation between normal ageing and MCI. Until such time that a culturally adapted version of the MoCA has been developed and validated for this population, we suggest lowering the cut-off score to 24 in order to reduce false-positive diagnoses of MCI.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To assess the validity of embedded measures of performance validity, the effort index (EI) and effort scale (ES) of the repeatable battery for the assessment of neuropsychological status (RBANS), in Veterans with seizures; to compare the frequency of failure on the test of memory malingering (TOMM) in patients with epileptic versus psychogenic nonepileptic seizures (PNES). METHODS: Seizure diagnosis was established for 309 participants in epilepsy monitoring units using conventional diagnostic criteria who completed both the TOMM and RBANS. The criterion for performance invalidity was failure on any trial of the TOMM. We examined multiple EI and ES cutoffs to establish optimal sensitivity and specificity. RESULTS: An RBANS EI cutoff score of greater than three was optimal with specificity of .98, sensitivity of.19, and positive Likelihood Ratio of 10 but was not useful when below this cutoff. Confidence intervals indicate the need for confirmation of a failed EI with another performance validity test (PVT). No ES cutoff had sufficient specificity for clinical use. Invalid TOMM performance but not invalid RBANS performance was significantly more common in persons with PNES than in persons with epileptic seizures. CONCLUSIONS: In Veterans undergoing seizure monitoring, the RBANS EI was useful as a screen when positive that requires confirmation with another PVT. The RBANS ES was not useful. Invalid performance on the TOMM was more common in persons with PNES than in persons with epileptic seizures.},

   abstract = {Background and Aims: Recent investigations have highlighted the value of neuropsychological testing for the assessment and screening of Alcohol-Related Brain Damage (ARBD). The aim of the present study was to evaluate the suitability of the Addenbrooke's Cognitive Examination (ACE-III) and the Repeatable Battery for the Assessment of Neuropsychological Status (RBANS) for this purpose. Methods: Comparing 28 participants with ARBD (11 with Korsakoff's Syndrome and 17 with the umbrella "ARBD" diagnosis) and 30 alcohol-dependent participants without ARBD (ALs) we calculated Area Under the Curve (AUC) statistics, sensitivity and specificity values, base-rate adjusted predictive values, and likelihood ratios for both tests. Results: High levels of screening accuracy were found for the total scores of both the ACE-III (AUC = 0.823, 95% CIs [0.714, 0.932], SE = 0.056; optimal cut-off </=86: sensitivity = 82%, specificity = 73%) and RBANS (AUC = 0.846, 95% CIs [0.746, 0.947], SE = 0.052; optimal cut-off </=83: sensitivity = 89%, specificity = 67%) at multiple cut-off points. Removing participants with a history of polysubstance from the samples (10 ALs and 1 ARBD) improved the diagnostic capabilities of the RBANS substantially (AUC = 0.915, 95% CIs [0.831, 0.999], SE = 0.043; optimal cut-off </=85: sensitivity = 98%, specificity = 80%), while only minor improvements to the ACE-III's accuracy were observed (AUC = 0.854, 95% CIs [0.744, 0.963], SE = 0.056; optimal cut-off </=88: sensitivity = 85%, specificity = 75%). Conclusion: Overall, both the ACE-III and RBANS are suitable tools for ARBD screening within an alcohol-dependent population, though the RBANS is the superior of the two. Clinicians using these tools for ARBD screening should be cautious of false-positive outcomes and should therefore combine them with other assessment methods (e.g., neuroimaging, clinical observations) and more detailed neuropsychological testing before reaching diagnostic decisions.},

   abstract = {The importance of evaluating effort in neuropsychological assessments has been widely acknowledged, but measuring effort in the context of dementia remains challenging due to the impact of dementia severity on effort measure scores. Two embedded measures have been developed for the repeatable battery for the assessment of neuropsychological status (RBANS; Randolph, C., Tierney, M. C., Mohr, E., & Chase, T. N. (1998). The repeatable battery for the assessment of neuropsychological status (RBANS): Preliminary clinical validity.

We explored failure rates on these effort measures in a non-litigating mixed dementia sample (N = 145). Failure rate on the EI was high (48%) and associated with dementia severity. In contrast, failure on the ES was 14% but differed based on type of dementia. ES failure was low (4%) when dementia was due to Alzheimer disease (AD), but high (31%) for non-AD dementias. These data raise concerns about use of the RBANS embedded effort measures in dementia evaluations.},

   abstract = {The objective of this study was to determine whether administration of the Repeatable Battery for the Assessment of Neuropsychological Status (RBANS) prior to other neuropsychological testing improves performance on subsequent measures due to practice effects. Participants completed the RBANS and related neuropsychological measures of the same cognitive domain in one of two counterbalanced orders. A MANOVA and follow-up independent t-tests were used to examine whether or not completing one set of measures prior to the other was associated with score differences. Prior administration of the RBANS did not impact performance on subsequent testing. However, a significant effect of test order administration was found such that the group administered the RBANS second performed worse on RBANS delayed memory measures. This finding was likely due to proactive interference, given that items from initially administered memory measures presented as intrusions on subsequently administered memory measures. Current results indicate that the practice of administering the RBANS as a screener prior to administration of additional tests will not impact performance on the subsequent tests. Although practice effects were not found, clinicians and researchers administering memory measures with similar designs (e.g., verbal list-learning tasks) within a single testing session should be aware of the potential of interference effects.},

   abstract = {Background: Recently, the cognitive impairment of patients with alcohol dependence has attracted more and more attention. The combination of Repeatable Battery for the Assessment of Neuropsychological Status (RBANS) and event-related potentials (ERPs) for evaluating the degree of cognitive impairment in patients with alcohol dependence has not undergone enough in-depth investigation. Method: Sixty patients with alcohol dependence were selected as alcohol-dependence group, whereas 40 healthy volunteers served as a normal control group. The original scores of the RBANS sub-items, the incubation period, and volatility of ERPs between the two groups were compared, and the correlation among the above indicators in the alcohol-dependence group was further analyzed. Results: The RBANS test showed that the original scores of speech function, attention function, delayed memory, and immediate attention in the alcohol-dependence group were significantly lower than those in the normal control group. Compared with the normal control group, the latencies of P200 and P300 in the alcohol-dependence group were significantly prolonged, and the amplitude of P200 and P300 was significantly reduced. Correlation analysis between RBANS and ERPs in alcohol-dependence group showed that immediate attention score was positively correlated with P300 and P200 amplitude, visual breadth score was positively correlated with P200 latency, and attention function score was negatively correlated with P300 latency. Conclusion: As RBANS scale was highly correlated with the results of ERPs, the combined use of these two scales may serve as an objective basis for early diagnosis of cognitive impairment in patients with alcohol dependence.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Many tinnitus patients report cognitive deficits such as concentration and attention difficulties. The aim of this study was to comprehensively assess cognitive functioning in tinnitus patients using a standardized test battery, the repeatable battery for the assessment of neuropsychological status adjusted for hearing impaired individuals (RBANS-H). STUDY DESIGN: Cross-sectional study. SETTING: Tertiary referral center. PARTICIPANTS: Twenty-eight chronic tinnitus patients and 28 control participants, matched for sex, age, hearing loss, and education level. INTERVENTION: Diagnostic. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: All participants completed the RBANS-H, which includes subtests probing immediate and delayed memory, visuospatial capabilities, language, and attention. The tinnitus patients completed the tinnitus functional index (TFI), a visual analogue scale (VAS) measuring subjective mean tinnitus loudness and the hyperacusis questionnaire (HQ). RESULTS: The total RBANS-H scores did not differ between tinnitus patients and controls. However, on the language subscale, mean scores of the tinnitus group (97.6 +/- 11.0) were significantly lower than those of controls (104.4 +/- 12.0), with correction for sex, age, hearing level, and education level (general linear model: p = 0.034). Post hoc t tests revealed a specific deficit concerning the semantic fluency subtest (tinnitus: 19.5 +/- 6.2; control: 23.1 +/- 5.9; p = 0.015). VAS scores for tinnitus loudness were negatively correlated to scores on the RBANS-H attention subscale (r = -0.48, p = 0.012). CONCLUSIONS: The current study successfully employed the RBANS-H to provide a broader view on cognitive functioning in tinnitus patients. The results showed a specific negative influence of tinnitus on verbal fluency, which could be related to a deficit in executive cognitive control. Moreover, patients experiencing louder tinnitus performed worse on specific subtests concerning attention.},

This investigation examined the rates of suboptimal scores on the EI and effort scale in a Parkinson's disease (PD) sample. METHOD: One hundred and sixty-three participants who have been diagnosed with PD by a board-certified neurologist were included in the study. The base rate of suboptimal scores on the EI and effort scale was calculated for the entire group. RESULTS: On average, participants were 66.8 years of age (SD = 9.5) and had a mean education of 13.5 years (SD = 2.79). The mean Mini-Mental State Examination score was 27.0 (SD = 3.1). Overall, 8% of participants scored below the cut-off for optimal performance on the EI while 62.6% performed in the suboptimal range for the effort scale. CONCLUSION: The utility of the EI and the effort scale in PD populations warrants further examination. Additionally, results demonstrate the need for validation of embedded RBANS effort measures in various disease populations.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVES: There has been a recent impetus to develop short and portable instruments for the cognitive assessment of patients with schizophrenia in clinical settings, but direct comparative data are lacking. The objectives of the present study were to compare the psychometric properties of two such batteries, the BACS (Brief Assessment of Cognition in Schizophrenia) and the RBANS (Repeatable Battery for the Assessment of Neuropsychological Status). METHODS: The French version of the BACS and the RBANS was administered to 36 patients with schizophrenia and schizoaffective disorder, and 14 healthy controls. A subgroup of patients was also tested with a standard battery (WAIS-III). RESULTS: Both instruments were easily administrable. Internal consistency was satisfying (global scale reliability alphas of 0.90 for the BACS, and 0.87 for the RBANS), although some sub-scores from the RBANS decreased the overall consistency of the instrument. BACS and RBANS composite scores were highly correlated to verbal, non-verbal and total WAIS-III scores (BACS: r=0.727, 0.865 and 0.857, respectively; RBANS: r=0.843, 0.747 and 0.875, respectively). Patients underperformed controls by a magnitude of 1.81 SD (BACS), and 0.78 SD (RBANS), after adjusting for education. Both batteries showed good test-retest reliability, except for three sub-scores from the RBANS. CONCLUSION: The psychometric properties and ease of use of the BACS and the RBANS were overall satisfying. The BACS demonstrated better internal consistency and test-retest reliability than the RBANS and was nominally more sensitive to diagnosis.},

   abstract = {Background: Currently, an independent relationship between hearing loss and cognitive decline in older adults is suggested by large prospective studies. In general, cochlear implants improve hearing and the quality of life in severely to profoundly hearing impaired older persons. However, little is known about the effects of cochlear implantation on the cognitive evolution in this population. Aim of the study: The primary goal of this prospective, longitudinal cohort study is to explore the cognitive profile of severely to profoundly postlingually hearing impaired subjects before and after cochlear implantation. In addition, the current study aims to investigate the relationship between the cognitive function, audiometric performances, quality of life, and self-reliance in these patients. Methods: Twenty-five patients aged 55 or older, scheduled for cochlear implantation, will be enrolled in the study. They will be examined prior to implantation, at 6 and 12 months after implantation and annually thereafter. The test battery consists of (1) a cognitive examination, using the Repeatable Battery for the Assessment of Neuropsychological Status adapted for Hearing impaired persons (RBANS-H), (2) an audiological examination, including unaided and aided pure tone audiometry, speech audiometry in quiet and speech audiometry in noise, (3) the administration of four questionnaires evaluating quality of life and subjective hearing benefit and (4) a semi-structured interview about the self-reliance of the participant. Discussion: Up until now only one study has been conducted on this topic, focusing on the short-term effects of cochlear implantation on cognition in older adults. The present study is the first study to apply a comprehensive neuropsychological assessment adapted for severely to profoundly hearing impaired subjects in order to investigate the cognitive capabilities before and after cochlear implantation. Trial registration: The present protocol is retrospectively registered at Clinical Trials (ClinicalTrials.gov) on June 9th, 2016. The first participant was enrolled on June 22nd, 2015. The protocol identifier is NCT02794350.},

   abstract = {Primary Objective: To compare cognitive functioning among experienced, unilateral cochlear implant (CI) recipients and normal-hearing (NH) controls by means of the Repeatable Battery for the Assessment of Neuropsychological Status for Hearing-impaired individuals (RBANS-H). Methods: Sixty-one post-lingually and bilaterally severely hearing-impaired CI recipients (median age: 71.0, range: 58.3 to 93.9 years) with at least 1 year of CI experience (median: 12.4, range: 1.1 to 18.6 years) and 81 NH control participants (median age: 69.9, range: 50.1 to 87.1 years) took part in this cross-sectional study. The RBANS-H was performed, as well as an audiometric assessment, including best-aided speech audiometry in quiet (monosyllabic words) and in noise (Leuven Intelligibility Sentences test). Results: The RBANS-H performances of the CI recipients (mean: 88.1 +/- 14.9) were significantly poorer than the those of the NH participants (mean: 100.5 +/- 13.2), with correction of age, sex, and education differences (general linear model: p = 0.001). The mean difference, corrected for the effects of these three demographic factors, was 8.8 (+/- 2.5) points. Additionally, in both groups, a significant correlation was established between overall cognition and speech perception, both in quiet and in noise, independently of age. Conclusion: Experienced, unilateral CI recipients present subnormal cognitive functioning, beyond the effect of age, sex and education. This has implications for auditory rehabilitation after CI and may highlight the need for additional cognitive rehabilitation in the long term after implantation. Long-term prospective and longitudinal investigations are imperative to improve our understanding of cognitive aging in severely hearing-impaired individuals receiving CIs and its association with CI outcomes.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To evaluate cognitive change in severely hearing-impaired older adults after cochlear implantation. STUDY DESIGN: Prospective, longitudinal cohort study with assessments before, and at 6 and 12 months after implantation. PATIENTS: Twenty older adults (median age: 71.5 yr). MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Change in the Repeatable Battery for the Assessment of Neuropsychological Status for Hearing-impaired individuals (RBANS-H) total score and subdomain scores were used to assess cognitive evolution. In addition, change in best-aided speech audiometry in quiet (monosyllabic words) and in noise (Leuven Intelligibility Sentences Test [LIST]) was examined, as well as patient-reported measures of health-related quality of life (Nijmegen Cochlear Implant Questionnaire [NCIQ]), self-perceived hearing disability (Speech, Spatial, and Qualities of hearing Scale-12 [SSQ12]), sound quality (Hearing Implant Sound Quality Index-19 [HISQUI19]), and states of anxiety and depression (Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale [HADS]). RESULTS: The RBANS-H total scores improved significantly after 12 months cochlear implant (CI) usage (p < 0.001). At subdomain level, significant improvements were observed in the immediate and delayed memory domain (p = 0.005 and p = 0.002, respectively), and to a lesser extent also in the attention domain (p = 0.047). Furthermore, speech perception in quiet and in noise improved significantly after 6 months and remained stable after 12 months. Similarly, a significant improvement was observed on all patient-reported measures after 6 months of CI usage. These results remained stable after 12 months, except for the HADS. CONCLUSIONS: A significant improvement in overall cognition after 12 months of CI usage was established. However, future research is imperative to further disentangle possible practice effects from the effects of the cochlear implantation. The significant, positive effect of cochlear implantation on speech perception and patient-reported measures was confirmed.},

The current study was aimed at determining the diagnostic accuracy of a novel percent retention score calculated from RBANS verbal memory subtests (delayed recall minus last learning trial) when distinguishing between normal controls, individuals diagnosed with Mild Cognitive Impairment, and individuals diagnosed with Alzheimer's disease. Results revealed excellent diagnostic accuracy of the RBANS percent retention scores when discriminating between the three groups.

   abstract = {Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common cause of dementia in the adult population. Tools capable of detecting predementia and established diagnoses of dementia are very important for assessing these patients. The Repeatable Battery for the Assessment of Neuropsychological Status (RBANS) is a brief neuropsychological battery that has been successful at detecting cognitive impairment in degenerative and nondegenerative neurological diseases. The objective of this study was to test reliability and sensibility and obtain normative data of a Spanish adaptation of the RBANS. In this study, 50 participants with AD and 336 healthy participants stratified according to the Spanish Census, with different levels of education, were tested with the RBANS (Form A). Descriptive analyses were performed on a pilot sample from the general population, and comparative analyses were performed on data from the two samples. We obtained an overall reliability coefficient (Cronbach's alpha) of .92. RBANS showed strong specificity and moderately low sensitivity. Participants in the AD group performed significantly worse on most subtests than control participants. Implications with regard to the specificity and sensitivity of the Spanish version of the RBANS are discussed.},

METHOD: Participants were 486 individuals recruited through a longitudinal aging research study in the southeastern United States. Participants were 69.3% female, an average of 69.96 years old (SD = 6.58), 16.32 years of education (SD = 2.27), and Mini-Mental Status Exam score of 29.12 (SD = 1.16). Participants completed the RBANS at baseline and yearly thereafter, as well as the Uniform Data Set demographic and health questionnaires and the Geriatric Depression Scale. RESULTS: Multilevel modeling was conducted using standardized RBANS index scores. Overall, across indices, performance generally improved across time consistent with practice effects from repeated testing. Some CVRFs were associated with worse performance over time. For example, individuals with hypertension performed more poorly on immediate memory over time (t = -2.06, p < .05). Other CVRFs (e.g., BMI) were not associated with baseline performance or performance over time. (p > .05). CONCLUSIONS: CVRFs differentially affect RBANS performance over time. These results extend previous cross-sectional findings regarding the impact of different cardiovascular health risks to a large, cognitively healthy, longitudinal sample.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: We aimed to examine the discriminant validity of a brief self-administered cognitive screening test, the Test Your Memory (TYM) and a brief neuropsychological test, the Repeatable Battery for the Assessment of Neuropsychological Status (RBANS), supplemented with executive and language tests (Color Trail Test [CTT] and modified Boston Naming Test [mBNT], respectively), in detecting cognitive impairment (CI) in a one-stop memory clinic in Singapore. METHODS: Ninety patients >/=50 years old with a diagnosis of no cognitive impairment, mild cognitive impairment, and mild Alzheimer disease were recruited from memory clinic. They received the TYM, Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE), Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA), RBANS, CTT, mBNT, and a gold-standard formal neuropsychological test battery. RESULTS: The TYM had a significantly larger area under the curve (AUC) than MMSE (0.96 vs 0.88, P = .03) and was equivalent to MoCA in detecting CI (0.96 vs 0.95, P = .80). At the optimal cutoff points, the TYM (<38) was significantly more sensitive than the MMSE (<24) and MoCA (<20; P < .001). The RBANS had an AUC equivalent to the RBANS supplemented with CTT and mBNT (0.92 vs 0.86, P = .22) in detecting CI. The RBANS supplemented with CTT and mBNT was more sensitive than RBANS alone in detecting CI (sensitivity: 0.98 vs 0.93, P = .016) among patients screened negative using TYM. CONCLUSION: The self-administered TYM is superior to MMSE and equivalent to MoCA in detecting CI and could be implemented routinely. The RBANS supplemented with CTT and mBNT is more sensitive in detecting CI than RBANS alone therefore could be used for diagnostic purposes.},

Across a one-year retest interval, stability coefficients ranged from .58 to .83 for the Index scores, and from .51 to .83 for the subtest scores. Practice effects were largely absent, with most performances slightly decreasing at retest.

However, its ability to detect milder cognitive deficits in the elderly has not been examined. The current study examined the clinical utility of the RBANS by comparing two groups: Patients with Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI; n = 72) and cognitively intact peers (n = 71). Significant differences were observed on the RBANS Total score, 3 of the 5 Indexes, and 6 of the 12 subtests, with individuals with MCI performing worse than the comparison participants. Specificity was very good, but sensitivity ranged from poor to moderate. Areas under the receiver operating characteristic curves for the RBANS Immediate and Delayed Memory Indexes and the Total Scale score were adequate. Although significant differences were observed between groups and the areas under the curves were adequate, the lower sensitivity values of the RBANS suggests that caution should be used when diagnosing conditions such as MCI.},

   abstract = {Although initially developed as a brief dementia battery, the Repeatable Battery for the Assessment of Neuropsychological Status (RBANS) has not yet demonstrated its sensitivity, specificity, and positive and negative predictive powers in detecting cognitive impairment in patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD). Therefore, the current study examined the clinical utility of the RBANS by comparing two age-, education-, and gender-matched groups: patients with AD (n=69) and comparators (n=69). Significant differences (p<0.001) were observed on the RBANS Total score, all 5 Indexes, and all 12 subtests, with patients performing worse than the comparison participants. An optimal balance between sensitivity and specificity on RBANS scores was obtained when cutoffs of one and one and a half standard deviations below the mean of the comparison sample were implemented. Areas under the Receiver Operating Characteristic curves for all RBANS Indexes were impressive though Immediate and Delayed Memory Indexes were excellent (0.96 and 0.98, respectively). Results suggest that RBANS scores yield excellent estimates of diagnostic accuracy and that the RBANS is a useful screening tool in detection of cognitive deficits associated with AD.},

   abstract = {Visual construction and memory tasks are routinely used in neuropsychological assessment, but their subjective scoring criteria can negatively affect the reliability of these instruments. The current study examined the standard scoring criteria for the Figure Copy and Recall subtests of the RBANS and compared them to a modified set of scoring criteria in two samples. In both a large community dwelling sample of older adults and in a mixed clinical sample, the original scoring criteria consistently led to lower scores than the modified criteria. Inter-rater reliability was high for the modified scoring criteria, and no age effects were found with the modified scoring criteria. In both samples, the modified scoring criteria led to Figure Copy scores that more closely approximated other performances on the RBANS compared to the standard criteria, whereas both scoring systems led to plausible Figure Recall scores. Despite these results, the present study cannot identify one scoring criterion as the "better," but only points out the significant differences between them. Such differences can have important clinical implications, and practitioners and researchers who utilize the RBANS with patient samples should be cautious when interpreting low scores on Figure Copy and Recall if the standard criteria are used.},

As newer instruments are developed to measure current cognitive functioning, their relationships with premorbid estimates need to be evaluated. The current study examined the clinical utility of discrepancy scores between an estimate of premorbid intellect derived from demographic variables (i.e., Barona) and the Total score on the Repeatable Battery for the Assessment of Neuropsychological Status (RBANS) in three geriatric samples. A large community-dwelling "control" sample and two clinical samples were examined. As expected, there was little difference between estimated premorbid intellect and current RBANS Total Scale scores in the community-dwelling sample, while estimated premorbid intellect obtained from the two clinical samples significantly differed from obtained RBANS Total scores. Similar findings were observed on Discrepancy scores for the five Indexes of RBANS. The current findings, along with normative data on these discrepancy scores, can provide additional confidence for clinicians and researchers who need to determine cognitive decline when using these screening measures of neuropsychological status.},

Regression-based prediction formulas have been utilized with other patient and healthy control samples to predict follow-up test performance based on initial performance and demographic variables. Comparisons between predicted and observed follow-up performances can assist clinicians in making the determination of change in the individual patient. The current study developed regression-based prediction equations for the twelve subtests of the Repeatable Battery for the Assessment of Neuropsychological Status (RBANS) in a sample of 223 community dwelling older adults. All algorithms included both initial test performances and demographic variables. These algorithms were then validated on a separate elderly sample (n = 222). Minimal differences were present between Observed and Predicted follow-up scores in the Validation sample, suggesting that the prediction formulas would be useful for practitioners who assess older adults. A case example is presented that utilizes the formulas.},

   abstract = {The Effort Index (EI) of the RBANS was developed to assist clinicians in discriminating patients who demonstrate good effort from those with poor effort. However, there are concerns that older adults might be unfairly penalized by this index, which uses uncorrected raw scores. Using five independent samples of geriatric patients with a broad range of cognitive functioning (e.g., cognitively intact, nursing home residents, probable Alzheimer's disease), base rates of failure on the EI were calculated. In cognitively intact and mildly impaired samples, few older individuals were classified as demonstrating poor effort (e.g., 3% in cognitively intact). However, in the more severely impaired geriatric patients, over one third had EI scores that fell above suggested cutoff scores (e.g., 37% in nursing home residents, 33% in probable Alzheimer's disease). In the cognitively intact sample, older and less educated patients were more likely to have scores suggestive of poor effort. Education effects were observed in three of the four clinical samples. Overall cognitive functioning was significantly correlated with EI scores, with poorer cognition being associated with greater suspicion of low effort. The current results suggest that age, education, and level of cognitive functioning should be taken into consideration when interpreting EI results and that significant caution is warranted when examining EI scores in elders suspected of having dementia.},

The present study tested the theoretically formulated five-factor structure, as well as three alternative factor solutions, using a combination of exploratory and confirmatory factor analytic approaches. The present study utilized archival data from a clinical sample of 150 older adults who were evaluated at an outpatient neuropsychological service. A total of four RBANS models were specified using confirmatory factor analysis. Results of the five-factor model demonstrated good to excellent fit following modifications to the model. Results of chi-square difference tests demonstrated that the five-factor model was statistically superior to the two- and three-factor models (p < .001). In summary, results provide support for the theoretically derived five-factor structure of the RBANS in a clinical sample of older adults. Cautious interpretation of the RBANS index scores as five distinct cognitive domains may be warranted, particularly when there is minimal discrepancy across performance on the tests that comprise each index.},

Secondary aims were to examine the potential validity and utility of the resulting factor structure. Literature was identified through a review of PsycINFO, PubMed, MEDLINE, Academic Search Complete, Psychology & Behavioral Sciences Collection, CINAHL Complete, Health Source: Nursing/Academic Edition, and SocINDEX. A two-stage meta-analytic structural equation modeling method was implemented to pool correlation matrices from primary studies and perform confirmatory factor analyses. Following model selection, factor scores were computed for two datasets and subjected to correlation and diagnostic accuracy analyses. A pooled correlation matrix was computed from 24 sample correlation matrices (N = 5299). Confirmatory factor analysis revealed that the theoretical five-factor model produced the best fit but only when error terms between Story Memory and Story Recall as well as between Figure Copy and Figure Recall were included. Regression-based factor scores showed mixed relationships with the manual-defined indices, and the overall diagnostic accuracy of the factor scores was adequate in both samples examined (AUC = 0.71 and 0.87). The five-factor model was an unexpected result given the failure of multiple previous studies to find support for that model. The five-factor model demonstrates several areas of potential improvement, including better representation of the factors by the indicators. The factor scores implied by this model also require further validation.},

The WTAR standard score was also found to contribute uniquely and significantly to the prediction of RBANS performance. Results of diagnostic accuracy analyses showed similar discriminating accuracy for all scores. There was limited support for using the WTAR over demographic variables alone in the estimation of RBANS performance; however, the WTAR was found to be more predictive than education, indicating potential clinical utility to using the word-reading score over just years of attained education. CONCLUSIONS: Use of these derived Total Scale score variants is recommended for the screening of cognitive impairment, particularly in individuals with superior or poor educational quality. Further research is required to evaluate the utility of these variations in more diverse samples.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Gender differences exist in schizophrenia and bipolar disorder (BD), therefore the aim of the present study was to clarify the role of gender in cognitive deficits in these disorders. METHODS: Cognitive performance was examined in schizophrenia (24M : 14F) and BD (16M : 24F) patients compared with age-, IQ- and gender-matched control participants (21M : 22F). The Repeatable Battery for the Assessment of Neuropsychological Status (RBANS) was used to assess five cognitive domains: immediate memory/learning, visuospatial ability, language, attention, and delayed memory, which are summed to provide a Total score. RESULTS: In comparison to controls, schizophrenia patients showed deficits on all domains, while BD patients had impaired immediate memory/learning, language and Total score. Schizophrenia patients showed deficits compared to BD in the Total score, immediate and delayed memory and visuospatial ability. The Total and domain scores were not different in men and women across or within groups. There were gender effects on four of the 12 individual cognitive tasks, in which female patients outperformed male patients. Further, there were gender differences across groups for three of the individual tasks: female schizophrenia patients showed poorer story memory and story recall compared to male schizophrenia patients; female BD patients had enhanced figure copy performance compared to male BD patients. CONCLUSIONS: The RBANS highlighted the cognitive deficits in schizophrenia and BD patients compared to controls and also each other. There were no overall gender differences in cognition.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVE: The Repeatable Battery for the Assessment of Neuropsychological Status (RBANS) has been used extensively for clinical care and in research for patients with mild cognitive impairment and Alzheimer's disease (AD); however, relatively few studies have evaluated the relationship between RBANS performance and AD imaging biomarkers. The purpose of the current study was to evaluate the association between a relatively new amyloid positron emission tomography imaging biomarker and performance on the RBANS. METHODS: Twenty-seven nondemented community-dwelling adults over the age of 65 underwent (18)F-Flutemetamol amyloid- positron emission tomography imaging, along with cognitive testing using the RBANS and select behavioral measures. Partial correlation coefficients were used to identify relationships between the imaging and behavioral markers. RESULTS: After controlling for age and education, amyloid deposition and RBANS Indexes of Immediate Memory, Delayed Memory, and Total Scale score were significantly correlated (p's < .001, r's = -.73 to -.77, d's = 2.13-2.39), with greater amyloid burden being associated with lower RBANS scores. The Delayed Memory Index was particularly highly associated with (18)F-Flutemetamol binding (r(2) = .59, p < .001, d = 2.39). Neither (18)F-Flutemetamol binding nor RBANS performance was significantly correlated with levels of depression, subjective cognitive difficulties, or premorbid intellect. CONCLUSIONS: Because of the limited use of amyloid imaging in clinical settings due to high cost and lack of reimbursement, these findings suggest that in particular RBANS Delayed Memory Index may be a cost-efficient tool to identify early signs of AD pathology, and its use may enlighten clinical decision-making regarding potential progression to dementia due to AD.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: A novel learning slope score - the Learning Ratio (LR) - has recently been developed that appears to be sensitive to memory performance and AD pathology more optimally than traditional learning slope calculations. While promising, this research to date has been both experimental and based on group differences, and therefore does not aid in the interpretation of individual LR performance for either clinical or research settings. The objective of the current study was to develop demographically-corrected normative data on these LR learning slopes on verbal learning measures from the Repeatable Battery for the Assessment of Neuropsychological Status (RBANS). METHOD: The current study examined the influence of age and education on LR metrics for the List Learning, Story Memory, and an Aggregated RBANS score in 200 cognitively intact adults aged 65 or older using linear regression. RESULTS: Age and education correlated with most LR metrics, but no sex differences were observed. Linear regression permitted the prediction of LR values from age and education, which are then compared to observed LR values. The result is demographically-corrected T scores for these LR metrics. CONCLUSIONS: By comparing observed and predicted LR scores calculated from regression-based prediction equations, this represents the first step towards interpretation of individual performances on this metric for clinical decision making and treatment planning purposes. With future replication in diverse and heterogenous samples, we hope to offer a new clinical tool for the examination of learning slopes in older adults.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: The learning ratio (LR) is a novel learning slope score that has been developed to reduce the inherent competition between the first trial and subsequent trials in traditional learning slopes. In essence, the LR is the number of items learned after the first trial divided by the number of items yet to be learned. Criterion and convergent validation of this LR score is warranted to understand its sensitivity along the Alzheimer's disease (AD) continuum. METHOD: The LR metric was calculated for 123 participants from standard measures of memory, including the Hopkins Verbal Learning Test-Revised, Brief Visuospatial Memory Test-Revised, Repeatable Battery for the Assessment of Neuropsychological Status (RBANS) list learning, and RBANS story memory. All participants were categorized as normal cognition, mild cognitive impairment (MCI), or AD. LR performances were compared between groups, among other standard memory measures, and with regards to how well they discriminated cognitively impaired from unimpaired samples-and within diagnostic subgroups. RESULTS: Lower LR scores were observed for the MCI and AD groups than the normal cognition group, with the AD group performing worse than the MCI group for several slope calculations. Lower LR scores were also consistently associated with poorer performances on traditional memory measures. LR scores further displayed excellent receiver operator characteristics when differentiating those with and without cognitive impairment-and MCI from normal cognition. Overall, LR scores consistently outperformed traditional learning slope calculations across all analyses. CONCLUSIONS: This LR score is sensitive to memory dysfunction along the AD continuum, and results offer criterion and convergent validity for use of the LR metric to understand learning capacity.},

The current study sought to validate previously published standardized regression-based (SRB) equations for the Repeatable Battery for the Assessment of Neuropsychological Status (RBANS) Indexes and subtests.Methods: Duff and colleagues's SRB prediction equations, developed from 223 cognitively intact primary care patients, were applied to an independent sample of robustly cognitively intact (n = 129) community-dwelling older adults assessed with the RBANS twice over a one-year period.Results: Results suggest that the cognitively intact participants in the current validation sample possessed significantly better Observed Follow-up scores than was predicted based on Duff's developmental sample across most RBANS Indexes and many RBANS subtests, though significantly lower Observed Follow-up scores were observed for the Visuospatial/Constructional Index than was predicted. As a result of these findings, the current study calculated updated prediction algorithms for the RBANS Index and subtest scores from the sample of 129 cognitively intact participants.Conclusions: Duff's 2004 and 2005 SRB prediction equations for the RBANS Index and subtest scores failed to generalize to a sample of cognitively intact community-dwelling participants recruited from senior living centers and independent assisted living facilities. These updated SRB prediction equations - being developed from a more medically "clean" sample of cognitively intact older adults who remained stable over 12 months - have the potential to provide a more accurate assessment of reliable change in an individual patient.},

Method: Hammers and colleagues' SRB prediction equations were applied to two independent samples of community-dwelling older adults with amnestic Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI), including those recruited from the community (n = 64) and those recruited from a memory disorders clinic (n = 58). Results: While Observed Baseline and Observed Follow-up performances were generally comparable for both MCI samples over one year, both samples possessed significantly lower Observed One-Year Follow-up scores than were predicted based on Hammers and colleagues' development sample across many RBANS Indexes. Relatedly, both amnestic MCI samples possessed a greater percentage of participants either "declining" or failing to exhibit a long-term practice effect over one year relative to expectation across most Indexes. Further, the clinic-recruited amnestic MCI sample displayed worse baseline performances, smaller long-term practice effects, and greater proportions of individual participants exhibiting a decline across one year relative to the community amnestic MCI sample. Conclusions: These findings validate Hammers and colleagues' SRB prediction equations by (1) indicating their ability to identify clinically meaningful change across RBANS Indexes in independent samples, and (2) discriminating rates of cognitive change among cognitively nuanced samples.},

Diagnostic utility was assessed by comparing patients diagnosed with MCI to patients diagnosed with AD as well as to the ND group. The following cognitive domains were investigated: short-term memory, retention and long-term memory, language, attention, visuoconstruction, and overall cognitive functioning. Stepwise logistic regressions found that in the comparisons between MCI and ND, the Step 2 addition of construct comparable neuropsychological measures provided a significant diagnostic increase in the short-term memory and overall cognitive functioning models. In the comparisons between MCI and AD, the Step 2 additions provided a significant diagnostic increase in the short-term memory, visuoconstruction, and overall cognitive functioning models. Results suggested that the inclusion of construct similar neuropsychological tests significantly increases the diagnostic accuracy of the RBANS when attempting to identify more subtle cognitive deficits inherent in MCI.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To examine the link between RBANS scores and functional impairment. Functional status was evaluated through informant report using the clinical dementia rating (CDR) scale. METHODS: Archival data were reviewed from records of 99 patients in a memory disorder clinic (MDC) research database. Consensus-based diagnoses were Alzheimer's disease (AD; n = 48), mild cognitive impairment (MCI; n = 48), AD with vascular components; (n = 2) and dementia due to psychiatric conditions (n = 1). RESULTS: The RBANS language index score was significantly related to CDR domain scores of community affairs (p < .01), home and hobbies (p < .01), personal care (p < .05), memory (p < 0.01), and judgment (p < 0.01). RBANS immediate memory index scores were significantly related to (p < 0.05) the CDR Memory and judgment and problem solving domains. Based on these findings, follow-up regressions were conducted. Semantic fluency was significantly related to CDR memory (p < 0.01), judgment (p < 0.05), community affairs (p < 0.05), home/hobbies (p < 0.05), and personal care (p < 0.05) functional domains. Picture naming was significantly related to the CDR personal care domain (p < 0.05). List learning was significantly related to CDR memory functional domain (p < 0.01) and judgment (p < 0.05). Lastly, story memory was significantly related to the CDR judgment domain (p < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: The RBANS may be an indicator of functional impairment as well as a neuropsychological testing tool. The use of the RBANS could reduce the amount of testing that is administered to the patient, or can provide a way to compare other measurements of functional impairment to assess accuracy of findings.},

   abstract = {Development of the Repeatable Battery for the Assessment of Neuropsychological Status (RBANS) was theoretically driven, with the goal of providing an assessment of abilities across five cognitive domains. Since its development, numerous factor analytic studies have failed to provide empirical support for the proposed five-factor structure and, furthermore, have lacked consensus on the internal structure of this instrument. A key limitation of these prior studies is the use of normal or mixed clinical samples, a practice that can obscure distinctions that may be evident in specific homogeneous clinical samples. The current study examined the factor structure of the RBANS in a sample of 107 male Veterans diagnosed with probable Alzheimer's disease (AD). Confirmatory factor analysis of a model reflecting the five Index Scores (Immediate Memory, Visuospatial/Constructional, Language, Attention, and Delayed Memory) found that the proposed five-factor structure fit the data well. These findings suggest that the RBANS does measure five distinct constructs and use of Index Scores is appropriate. Furthermore, the current findings highlight the importance of testing construct validity of neuropsychological assessment instruments in specific homogeneous samples.},

   abstract = {Cognitive impairment has been identified in the early phase of schizophrenia spectrum disorders, and is a major contributor to disease-related disability. While screening tools assessing cognitive impairment have been validated for adult schizophrenic populations, there is a need for brief, easily administered, standardized instruments that provide clinically relevant information for adolescents. This study examines the utility of the Repeatable Battery for the Assessment of Neuropsychological Status (RBANS) in identifying and quantifying neurocognitive impairment in adolescents with schizophrenia spectrum disorders and other serious psychiatric illnesses. 112 adolescents, including 32 healthy subjects and 80 patients, were administered the RBANS. Patients with psychotic disorders demonstrated significant impairment on the RBANS total score compared to patients with other disorders and healthy controls, but this impairment appeared somewhat less severe than is typically reported for in adult patients with schizophrenia on this measure. The RBANS appears to be sensitive in the detection of neurocognitive impairment in a psychiatric population of adolescents with psychotic symptomatology, and may therefore have utility as a clinical screening instrument and/or neurocognitive outcome measure in this population.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Idiopathic descent of cerebellar tonsils into the cervical spine in Chiari malformation Type I (CMI) is typically associated with occipital headache. Accumulating evidence from experimental studies suggests cognitive effects of CMI. The aim of the current study was to examine the relationship between cognition and CMI using a battery of standardized neuropsychological and symptom inventory instruments. METHOD: Eighteen untreated adults with CMI, and 18 gender, age, and education matched healthy controls completed the Repeatable Battery for the Assessment of Neuropsychological Status (RBANS), and standardized measures of pain, mood, and disability. Morphometric measurements of key neural and osseous elements were also obtained from structural brain magnetic resonance images, for correlation with symptom outcomes. RESULTS: CMI patients exhibited deficits in RBANS attention, immediate memory, delayed memory, and total score. After controlling for pain and associated affective disturbance, the significant group effect for RBANS attention remained. CMI patients also presented seven morphometric differences comprising the cerebellum and posterior cranial fossa compartment that differed from healthy controls, some of which were associated with self-reported pain and disability. Notably, group differences in tonsillar position were associated with self-reported pain, disability, and delayed memory. CONCLUSION: Adult CMI is associated with domain-specific cognitive change, detectable using a standard clinical instrument. The extent of cognitive impairment is independent of pain or affective symptomatology and may be related to the key pathognomonic feature of the condition.

Clinical normative data for a large sample of inpatients and outpatients with schizophrenia spectrum disorders is available (Wilk, Gold, Humber, Dickerson, Fenton, & Buchanan, 2004). The purpose of this study was to replicate and extend the clinical normative data for the RBANS for use in inpatient psychiatry. Participants were 174 inpatients from a provincial psychiatric hospital with a diagnosis of schizophrenia spectrum disorder. Median performance on the RBANS was 1-2 standard deviations (SDs) below the mean. Patients with more than 12 years of education performed significantly better on every index score than patients with 12 or fewer years of education. Men performed better than women on the Visuospatial/Constructional Index (Cohen's d= .47). When examining all five Index scores simultaneously, it was common for inpatients to obtain three or more frankly impaired scores (i.e., less than the 2nd percentile). Overall, the performance of this inpatient sample was very similar to the clinical normative data presented by Wilk et al. (2004). Detailed normative tables by diagnosis, education, and gender are provided.},

   abstract = {Cognitive deficits are a core feature of major depressive disorder (MDD). However, there are no previous studies that directly compare cognitive performance between first-episode drug-naive depressive patients (FDDP) and medicated depressive patients (MDP). Therefore, the aim of this study was to investigate whether there were the differences in cognitive functions between FDDP and MDP. Sixty-two FDDP, 111 MDP and 90 healthy controls were enrolled in a Chinese population. Cognitive functions were assessed using the Repeatable Battery for the Assessment of Neuropsychological Status (RBANS). There were the differences in the RBANS total score (F = 26.55, p < 0.001), subscales of immediate memory (F = 3.95, p = 0.02), language (F = 54.11, p < 0.001) and delayed memory (F = 11.19, p = 0.001) among the three groups after controlling for gender, education, smoking and body mass index (BMI). These differences in the RBANS total score, subscales of language and delayed memory passed the Bonferroni corrections (all, p < 0.05). Compared to healthy controls, FDDP and MDP had poorer cognitive performance including the RBANS total score, and subscales of language and delayed memory (all, p < 0.05) after controlling for the variables. FDDP experienced greater language deficits than MDP (p < 0.05) after controlling for the variables. Education was correlated with the language score in FDDP (r = 0.61, p < 0.001). Multivariate regression analysis indicated that education was an independent contributor to the language score in FDDP (ss = 3.11, t = 5.48, p < 0.001). Our findings indicated that FDDP had poorer language performance than MDP. Moreover, education could influence the language performance in FDDP.},

Across diagnostic contrasts, list percentage retention classification accuracy was similar to List Learning delayed recall, but below the Delayed Memory Index (DMI). Similarly, for classifying no cognitive impairment versus aMCI or dementia due to AD, story percentage retention was similar to Story Memory subtests and below the DMI. For classifying aMCI versus AD; however, Story Memory exceeded the DMI, but was similar to Story Memory subtest scores. Similarly, for prediction of function percentage retention measures did not predict variance beyond that predicted by the RBANS subtest or index scores. In sum, there is no evidence that calculation of percentage retention for RBANS adds clinical utility beyond those provided by the standard RBANS scores.},

There currently is no clearly-established "gold standard" for this purpose. The Repeatable Battery for the Assessment of Neuropsychological Status (RBANS) is a widely used neuropsychological test battery for the clinical diagnosis/tracking of dementia also recently incorporated into clinical trials of new investigational medications for AD treatment. The RBANS has a number of design features that suggest possible utility in diagnosis/tracking of MCI. Eighty-one patients with MCI completed the RBANS and their scores were compared with 81 demographically matched healthy controls. RBANS Total Scale scores in both groups were normally distributed, demonstrating no floor/ceiling effects. The MCI group was most impaired on the Delayed Memory Index (DMI). Receiver operating characteristic analyses reflected good discrimination, with an area under the curve of 0.88 for the Total Scale score and 0.90 for the DMI score. The profile of performance for the MCI group was similar to that previously reported for mild AD patients. The RBANS may be a suitable neurocognitive battery for the detection and tracking of MCI presumed to be due to AD.},

The current study investigates the RBANS' sensitivity to acute TBI, hypothesizing that the presence and severity of injury is predictive of worse RBANS performance. METHOD: Neuropsychological testing was conducted an average of 6.1 days after emergence from post-traumatic amnesia (PTA). RBANS results were evaluated based on a normative basis, pre-injury estimates, and brain injury severity. RESULTS: In this sample of acute TBI patients (n = 51), the mean index scores on the RBANS ranged from 1.59-2.36 SD below the mean of the standardization sample. Each WRAT-4 Reading sub-test score was above the corresponding RBANS Total Scale Index score (t(31) = 10.32, p < 0.001). Regression analyses revealed that Delayed Memory (beta = - 0.365, p < 0.007) and Total Score (beta = -0.297, p < 0.023) indices were significantly predicted by PTA length after controlling for age and education. CONCLUSIONS: The RBANS appears to be a useful tool in assessing the presence and severity of acute TBI.},

Participants were 250 military service members (94.0% male; Age: M = 28.4, SD = 7.6) evaluated following mild TBI on average 7.4 months (SD = 15.6) post-injury. Participants were divided into two groups based on their performance on the Test of Memory Malingering: PVT-Pass, n = 193; PVT-Fail, n = 57. For the EI, recommended cut-offs for extremely probable, highly probable, and probable poor effort were established. A cut-off score of >3 resulted in low sensitivity (.14), high specificity (.99) and positive predictive power (.94), and moderate negative predictive power (.68) and is recommended for identifying highly probable poor effort. For both the EI and ES, cut-offs for probable poor effort were identified; however, classification accuracy was not much improved relative to simply using the sum of the List Recognition and Digit Span raw scores to classify poor effort. It is acknowledged that the use of a different criterion would likely have resulted in different findings. Nevertheless, findings support the use of the EI and the ES as a "red flag" for possible poor effort in mild TBI patients, but suggest that, in most cases, additional PVTs would be required to accurately rule poor effort in or out.},

   abstract = {Background: Neurocognitive assessments have become integral to comprehensive neuro-oncology care. Existing screening tools may be insensitive to cognitive changes caused by medical treatments. Research supports the clinical value and psychometric properties of the Repeatable Battery for the Assessment of Neuropsychological Status (RBANS) in various medical populations; however, there is minimal evidence for its use in neuro-oncology. The purpose of the current study was to further explore the cognitive profile of patients with primary brain tumor (PBT) using the RBANS and to assess rates of below-expectation performance compared to normative data and estimated intellectual functioning. Methods: Data were collected on 82 PBT patients (54% male; age range, 19-81 years). All patients were administered the RBANS-Update and the Advanced Clinical Solutions-Test of Premorbid Functioning (TOPF) according to standardized instructions. Cognitive strengths and weaknesses were identified for PBT patients. Descriptive analyses, t tests, and chi-squared tests were utilized to identify and compare cognitive profiles. Results: Overall, cognitive performance was low average for PBT patients. When compared to standardization data, PBT patients performed significantly worse across all 5 RBANS indexes, with Attention and Memory showing the largest discrepancies. Estimated intelligence analyses reflected greater deficits in cognitive functioning than when compared to a normal distribution. Conclusions: Preliminary research demonstrates the RBANS is an efficient screening tool to assess cognitive deficits in PBT patients. Data also support the importance of comparison to self, rather than normative distribution in ensuring proper identification and classification of patients.},

METHODS: The Register sample comprised 285 volunteers with schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder. Their RBANS performance was compared with US data from 575 predominantly outpatient-recruited schizophrenia patients. RESULTS: The Register sample displayed impairments in immediate and delayed memory, but near-normal language, attention and visuospatial-constructional performance (mean RBANS total score=88.72, SD=16.35). By contrast, health service-recruited schizophrenia patients displayed impairments on all RBANS scales (mean RBANS total score=70.54, SD=14.80). Within the Register sample, volunteers with low levels of current functioning had immediate and delayed memory performance comparable to the US schizophrenia sample. Gender and school completion status were also associated with different RBANS profiles. CONCLUSIONS: These findings reinforce the notion that a severity/functioning gradient exists across schizophrenia recruitment sources, which has important implications for research design and generalizability. Memory impairments have emerged as a central feature of schizophrenia.},

   abstract = {Alzheimer's disease (AD) and subcortical vascular dementia (SVaD) are among the most prevalent dementias and they often show specific patterns of cognitive dysfunction. This study examined whether differences exist between groups on the Repeatable Battery for the Assessment of Neuropsychological Status (RBANS) that could assist with differential diagnosis. The examiners utilized the NINCDS-ADRDA and the NINDS-AIREN criteria to identify 39 probable AD and 29 probable SVaD patients. A battery of neuropsychological tests was performed and neuroimaging was reviewed for all subjects. Analyses revealed that the SVaD group performed significantly better on the Delayed Memory Index (DMI) and its subtests measuring Recognition, Contextual Memory, and Figure Recall. In contrast to previous research, there were no differences between groups on immediate memory tasks, and post hoc analyses revealed no differences on any other index or subtest. The results also suggested that the DMI and its subtests and the Story Memory subtest of the Immediate Memory Index have better sensitivity to AD, better specificity to SVaD, and roughly equivalent positive predictive power compared with other components of the RBANS. Overall, findings suggest that the indices and subtests of the RBANS may be limited in differentiating AD versus SVaD, except for the DMI and its subtests.},

   abstract = {The RBANS has become increasingly utilized in various populations since it reliably assesses individual neurocognitive domains in a rapid, efficient manner. The present study examined the convergent validity of the RBANS to frequently administered instruments in a moderate-severe traumatic brain injured (M-S TBI) sample. Fifty-seven individuals who sustained a M-S TBI were included in this study. The RBANS subtests showed moderate to strong internal reliability within the sample. Most of the subtests displayed moderate to strong correlations with the other neuropsychological tests, including the CVLT-II, COWAT, and WAIS-III subtests. The strongest correlations were within the RBANS Attention Index, with both the Digit Span and Coding subtests showing strong correlations with their WAIS-III counterparts. The RBANS measures distinct abilities that supplement other neuropsychological instruments that assess similar functions within a TBI sample. In addition to its administration advantages, the results of this study provide support for the use of the RBANS as a clinical valid and reliable tool in the brief screening of individuals with M-S TBI.},

METHOD: 66 patients with ESLD awaiting liver transplant were recruited. Patients were evaluated with the RBANS, Peabody Picture Vocabulary Test-Revised, and Beck Depression Inventory-II. RESULTS: Patients with ESLD uniformly performed below expectations on all RBANS index scores compared to the healthy normative sample (all p's<.0001) and they also displayed a "subcortical" pattern of cognitive performance (p<.0001). Performances on RBANS attention, language, immediate memory, and total index scores were correlated with education and ethnicity (r's range=|.32-.57|; p's<.01). There was no association between performance on any of the RBANS index scores or subtests and ESLD patient characteristics. In summary, the RBANS appears to adequately characterize known patterns of cognitive dysfunction in ESLD patients.},

   abstract = {In a psychosocial treatment study, knowing which participants are likely to put forth adequate effort to maximize their treatment, such as attending group sessions and completing homework assignments, and knowing which participants need additional motivation before engagement in treatment is a crucial component to treatment success. This study examined the ability of the Repeatable Battery for Assessment of Neuropsychological Status (RBANS) Effort Index (EI), a newly developed measure of suboptimal effort that is embedded within the RBANS, to predict group attendance in a sample of 128 middle-aged and older adults with schizophrenia. This study was the first to evaluate the EI with a schizophrenia sample. While the EI literature recommends a cutoff score of >3 to be considered indicative of poor effort, a cutoff of >4 was identified as the optimal cutoff for this sample. Receiver Operating Characteristics curve analyses were conducted to determine if the EI could predict participants who had high versus low attendance. Results indicated that the EI was successfully able to discriminate between group attendance, and this measure of effort appears to be most valuable as a tool to identify participants who will have high attendance. Of interest, overall cognitive functioning and symptoms of psychopathology were not predictive of group attendance.},

This study assessed the effectiveness of the verbal memory and visual processing indices proposed by Duff et al. (2009) to differentiate participants with neurological disorders. Participants included individuals diagnosed with mild cognitive impairment (MCI; n = 38), Alzheimer's disease (AD; n = 100), or Parkinson's disease (PD; n = 35), with ages ranging from 65-93 years. In addition, normal control participants (n = 100) within the same age range were used for comparison. ANOVA and posthoc analyses revealed that the normal control and AD groups were significantly different from all groups for Verbal and Visual Indices. However, the MCI and PD groups did not differ from each other. Predictive discriminant analysis (PDA) assessed classification rates of the groups, and the normal participants were classified best (63% to 92%). The AD group followed with percentages ranging from 64% to 76%. Specifically, when classifying the normal and AD groups using both Verbal and Visual Indices of the RBANS together, sensitivity was 92.0% (n = 92) and specificity was 79.0% (n = 79). Overall classification rates for this analysis were 85.5%. Overall, the RBANS Verbal and Visual Indices may provide additional information when working with neurologically impaired older adults, with overall classification rates ranging from 61.5% to 85.5%.},

It has been translated and adapted to different languages and is widely used in other countries, but no Spanish version has been published. The objective was to make a valid translation of the RBANS to Spanish, and obtain a version adapted to the Spanish population. PATIENTS AND METHODS: The study included 73 subjects: 25 males with a mean age of 54 years and 9.72 years of education, and 48 females with a mean age of 53 years and 10.29 years of education. The battery was translated using the translation-back-translation method (with slight differences), followed by a descriptive pilot study in a sample of the normal population. RESULTS: An overall reliability coefficient with a Cronbach alpha of 0.73 was obtained in the translation and adaptation of the RBANS, Form A (1998). Statistically significant positive correlations between the indices were obtained. CONCLUSIONS: The version translated and adapted to Spanish performs similarly to the original version.},

   abstract = {INTRODUCTION: The Repeatable Battery for the Assessment of Neuropsychological Status (RBANS) is frequently used in clinical practice to evaluate cognitive function. It is quick to administer (20-30minutes) and is not influenced by a learning effect. The RBANS includes 4 parallel versions and has a high discriminative ability. Our study provides normative data from the RBANS-E (Spanish-language version of RBANS form A) for a Spanish population aged 20 to 89 years. METHODS: The study included 609 subjects aged 20 to 89 years. Participants were evaluated at baseline with a short interview, a cognitive screening test (Mini-Mental State Examination), and a functional scale (Rapid Disability Rating Scale). The RBANS-E was then administered to all 609 participants. RESULTS: Our results show the influence of education on all subtest scores. Sex was observed to have no impact on any subtest. CONCLUSION: Our study provides highly useful normative data for the cognitive evaluation of young and adult populations.},

This study focused on the ELD predictability of the cognitive outcome after VPS for NPH. In addition, Repeatable Battery for the Assessment of Neuropsychological Status (RBANS) was examined in ELD cognition screening. ELD results were considered positive with any improvement in gait and/or cognition. Among 36 patients examined for possible NPH, 26 underwent VPS because of positive ELD. Cognitive outcome after VPS was assessed at 6-month follow-up. The RBANS scores, examined pre- and post-ELD, were evaluated statistically to identify consistency with the neuropsychologist judgment and the predictability of cognitive outcome after VPS. Among 26 shunted patients, gait was improved in 24. Cognitive improvement was rated in 19, and there were 9 false negative and 5 false positive in ELD cognition screening. The neuropsychologist judgment in ELD cognition screening is most consistent with the RBANS score in delayed memory. The patients rated as improved in cognition after VPS had significantly lower RBANS scores pre-ELD in immediate memory and delayed memory. If both scores at pre-ELD were </= 80 (13 patients), all were rated as improved in cognition after VPS. ELD screening was highly predictive of clinical gait improvement but not of cognitive improvement after VPS for possible NPH. Particularly among patients with a positive ELD gait response, pre-ELD low RBANS scores in memory predicted cognitive improvement after VPS. RBANS seems effective in evaluating cognition for NPH.},

   abstract = {Background: Numerous studies have confirmed that long-term shift work is not only associated with increased health problems and acute impact on safety but also with impaired cognitive abilities. However, very little is known about effects of shift work on cognition-related brain resting-state networks. The aim of this study was to explore the effects of shift work disorder (SWD) on granger causality connection among resting-state brain networks. Methods: Thirty patients with SWD and 25 matched healthy subjects were recruited to undergo the Repeatable Battery for the Assessment of Neuropsychological Status (RBANS) and resting-state fMRI scanning. We employed independent component analysis (ICA) to extract resting-state brain networks and granger causality analysis (GCA) to characterize the difference of granger causality connection among cognition-related resting-state brain networks. Results: Compared with healthy subjects, patients with SWD showed impairments on the attention and immediate memory. Seven resting-state brain networks were identified, and patients with SWD showed more numerous granger causality connections in comparison with healthy subjects. Two-sample t test results showed that there were significantly increased inflows from the anterior default mode network (aDMN) to sensorimotor network (SMN) and left frontoparietal network (LFPN) to salience network (SN). Correlation analyses showed that the increased inflows from aDMN to SMN were negatively associated with the score of attention, while LFPN to SN were negatively associated with the score of visuospatial/constructional ability. Conclusions: This study indicates that SWD impairs cognitive performance, and the specific intrinsic brain granger causality connectivity among resting-state networks in SWD patients is affected after long-term shift works.},

   abstract = {We compare reliable change scores and recently published anchor-based cutoffs for minimum clinically important difference (MCID) for the Repeatable Battery for the Assessment of Neuropsychological Status (RBANS) in a sample of patients diagnosed with various forms of dementia. For memory clinic patients with dementia evaluated twice over a one-year interval (N = 53), observed retest RBANS index scores were compared with predicted retest index scores based on regression formulae developed from cognitively healthy older adults. Patient RBANS change scores were also compared to suggested MCID anchors. Patients with dementia demonstrated a reliable decline on most RBANS indices, with evidence that the Visuospatial/Constructional and Language Indices might be less sensitive to decline over time. Although there was consistency between MCID and reliable changes in this sample, there was a substantial proportion where the MCID was exceeded, with no reliable change. We attempted to create MCIDs from the Clinical Dementia Rating Sum of Box scores for RBANS reliable change scores, but failed to find significant associations. Overall, the findings support use of the regression based reliable change approach, but we caution use of the MCID approach for the RBANS.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Provide updated older adult (ages 60+) normative data for the Repeatable Battery for the Assessment of Neuropsychological Status (RBANS), Form A, using regression techniques, and corrected for education, age, and gender. METHOD: Participants (aged 60-93 years; N = 415) were recruited through the Healthy Ageing Research Program (HARP), University of Western Australia, and completed Form A of the RBANS as part of a wider neuropsychological test battery. Regression-based techniques were used to generate normative data rather than means-based methods. This methodology allows for the control of demographic variables using continuous data. To develop norms, the data were assessed for: (1) normality; (2) associations between each subtest score and age, education, and gender; (3) the effect of age, education, and gender on subtest scores; and (4) residual scores which were converted to percentile distributions. RESULTS: Differences were noted between the three samples, some of which were small and may not represent a clinically meaningful difference. Younger age, more years of education, and female gender were associated with better scores on most subtests. Frequency distributions, means, and standard deviations were produced using unstandardized residual scores to remove the effects of age, education, and gender. CONCLUSIONS: These normative data expand upon past work by using regression-based techniques to generate norms, presenting percentiles, as well as means and standard deviations, correcting for the effect of gender, and providing a free-to-use Excel macro to calculate percentiles.},

(e.g., Rapport, Axelrod, Theisen, Brines, Kalechstein, & Ricker, 1997; Rapport, Brines, Axelrod, & Theisen, 1997).

The CRIER represented the novel integration of cognitive test performance and depression self-report information. The sample included 234 patients without dementia who could be identified as having demonstrated either valid or invalid responding, based on standardized criteria. Sensitivity and specificity for invalid responding varied widely, with the CRIER emerging as the best all-around index (sensitivity = 0.84, specificity = 0.90, AUC = 0.94). Findings support the use of embedded response validity indices, and suggest that the integration of cognitive and self-report depression data may optimize detection of invalid responding among older Veterans.},

We evaluated the classification accuracy of the EI and ES against a standalone performance validity measure (Test of Memory Malingering; TOMM) in a mixed clinical patient sample. Our results showed limited utility for the ES in a mixed sample and modest classification accuracy for the EI, raising concerns about the appropriate scope of use for these scales in general clinical practice, which suggested that an alternate EI cutoff score of >0 may be most appropriate.},

(a) The sensitivity and reliability of the Repeatable Battery for the Assessment of Neuropsychological Status (RBANS) to detect cognitive impairment in schizophrenia. (b) The convergent validity of RBANS on a larger battery of neuropsychological tests sensitive to the cognition disorders typically observed in schizophrenia. (c) The correlates of poor performance in RBANS with clinical features and illness severity. METHOD: Thirty schizophrenia patients, 30 non-psychotic patients and 30 healthy participants were assessed using RBANS (form A). We administered a battery of neuropsychological tests and four scales to evaluate patient's clinical status. RESULTS: Schizophrenia patients and non-psychotic patients performed significantly worse than healthy controls on RBANS, and schizophrenia patients performed slightly worse than non-psychiatric controls, but this difference was not significant. Good inter-test reliability and concurrent validity were found. Only a moderate correlation between RBANS performance and illness severity was observed. CONCLUSIONS: RBANS revealed coherence in identifying cognitive impairment in schizophrenia patients of a different cultural background, and it is shown to be a sensitive, valid and easy-to-perform tool for the neuropsychological assessment of Spanish patients with schizophrenia.},

Significant moderate correlations were found between the UPSIT and each of the RBANS indexes, with the strongest correlation for Total Scale score, followed by the Delayed Memory Index and the Language Index. Significant moderate correlations were also found between the UPSIT and 11 of the 12 subtests of the RBANS. While the major RBANS indexes demonstrated significant correlations with education and the Wechsler Test of Adult Reading, a measure of premorbid IQ, the UPSIT did not. This suggests the UPSIT may be sensitive to decline in dementia and largely unaffected by premorbid cognitive functioning. As a result, the UPSIT may provide neuropsychologists with an efficient, cost-effective, and sensitive supplement to a standard dementia battery.},

However, the index structure of the RBANS was derived theoretically and was not based on factor analysis. The purpose of this study was to examine the factor structure in a large heterogeneous sample of patients referred for a dementia evaluation, using exploratory factor analysis. Results suggest a two-factor solution, the first factor defined predominantly as a memory factor and the second as predominantly a visuospatial factor. This study also sought to validate the obtained factors by examining their relationship with external neuropsychological variables. Correlations between the external variables provide further support for Factor 1 as a memory factor. Correlations with Factor 2 support its visuospatial features, although this factor may also be associated with other cognitive domains such as attention and general ability.},

Although the Repeatable Battery for the Assessment of Neuropsychological Status (RBANS) is becoming a popular screening battery for cognitive functions, normative data on retention rates are not available. The retention rates of verbal and visual material were evaluated in a sample of clinical patients (n = 109) compared to a healthy control group (n = 718). Individual subtest retention rates were converted to age-corrected scaled scores based on the cumulative distribution of raw scores obtained by an elderly community-dwelling sample. Compared with the healthy normative sample, the percent retention found for the clinical group was significantly lower on all 3 RBANS memory subtests. These preliminary data suggest that retention rates of the RBANS memory subtests may add to the clinical utility of this test as a neuropsychological diagnostic and research tool.},

   abstract = {Parkinson's disease (PD) is progressive neurological disease characterized by resting tremor, rigidity, akinesia, postural instability and cognitive changes. The symptoms of PD are debilitating and often become unsatisfactorily treated by medication. Deep brain stimulation (DBS) is an effective treatment to significantly reduce the cardinal motor symptoms of PD. However, the neuropsychological effects of this treatment are less clear. This study examined pre- to post-DBS scores on the Repeatable Battery for the Assessment of Neuropsychological Status (RBANS) using Reliable Change Indices (RCIs) derived from 20 patients with PD who were medically managed, and then compared to 20 patients with PD treated with DBS and medication. When using group statistical analyses and false discovery rate correction, no significant differences between or within groups were evident at baseline or at follow-up. However, when using the RCIs more patients in the DBS group exhibited reliable change in RBANS scores than did the Med Tx group. Although preliminary, these RCIs provide clinicians and researchers a foundational tool for assessing the effects of interventions (e.g., DBS) independent of the effects of PD and measurement error when using the RBANS.},

   abstract = {Neuropsychology practice organizations have highlighted the need for thorough evaluation of performance validity as part of the neuropsychological assessment process. Embedded validity indices are derived from existing measures and expand the scope of validity assessment. The Repeatable Battery for the Assessment of Neuropsychological Status (RBANS) is a brief instrument that quickly allows a clinician to assess a variety of cognitive domains. The RBANS also contains multiple embedded validity indicators. The purpose of this study was to synthesize the utility of those indicators to assess performance validity. A systematic search was completed, resulting in 11 studies for synthesis and 10 for meta-analysis. Data were synthesized on four indices and three subtests across samples of civilians, service members, and veterans. Sufficient data for meta-analysis were only available for the Effort Index, and related analyses indicated optimal cutoff scores of >/=1 (AUC = .86) and >/= 3 (AUC = .85). However, outliers and heterogeneity were present indicating the importance of age and evaluation context. Overall, embedded validity indicators have shown adequate diagnostic accuracy across a variety of populations. Recommendations for interpreting these measures and future studies are provided.},

   abstract = {The Repeatable Battery for the Assessment of Neuropsychological Status (RBANS) is a cognitive battery that contains scales of several cognitive abilities, but no scale in the instrument is exclusively dedicated to executive functioning. Although the subtests allow for observation of executive-type errors, each error is of fairly low base rate, and healthy and clinical normative data are lacking on the frequency of these types of errors, making their significance difficult to interpret in isolation. The aim of this project was to create an RBANS executive errors scale (RBANS EE) with items comprised of qualitatively dysexecutive errors committed throughout the test. Participants included Veterans referred for outpatient neuropsychological testing. Items were initially selected based on theoretical literature and were retained based on item-total correlations. The RBANS EE (a percentage calculated by dividing the number of dysexecutive errors by the total number of responses) was moderately related to each of seven established measures of executive functioning and was strongly predictive of dichotomous classification of executive impairment. Thus, the scale had solid concurrent validity, justifying its use as a supplementary scale. The RBANS EE requires no additional administration time and can provide a quantified measure of otherwise unmeasured aspects of executive functioning.},

   abstract = {Introduction: Only the Mini mental state examination (MMSE) and Montreal Cognitive Assessment scale have been validated in a Sri Lankan population for the assessment of cognitive functions. Both tests are deficient in the number of domains assessed. Therefore validation of Repeatable Battery for Assessment of Neuropsychological Status is important as it assesses most of the cognitive domains. Objectives: To culturally adapt RBANS and investigate the validity and reliability of culturally adapted RBANS (RBANS-S). Methods: Fifty four participants with major neurocognitive disorder and 60 normal controls aged >50 were administered with RBANS-S at the Cognitive Assessment Unit, Faculty of Medicine, Colombo and National Hospital of Sri Lanka. The participants were selected after a detailed clinical assessment according to Diagnostic and Statistical Manual - 5 criteria. Data were analysed using SPSS data package. Results: The mean age of the sample was 69.5 years. RBANS-S total scale correlated highly with MMSE total score, (Pearson correlational coefficient = 0.793 p=0.01). Criterion validity was assessed using receiver operating curve characteristic analysis and the area under the curve was 0.937. RBANS-S showed strong concurrent validity us indicated by its significant correlations with the MMSE. All of the RBANS-S subtests demonstrated significant correlations with the MMSE subsets. The sensitivity and specificity for RBANS-S was 89% and 85% respectively at a totals score of 80.5. The RBANS-S yielded a reliability coefficient of 0.929. Conclusions: Culturally adapted RBANS-S is a valid and reliable instrument which can be used in assessment of cognitive functions.},

   abstract = {PURPOSE: To evaluate the cognitive function in preoperative patients with severe carotid stenosis. PATIENTS AND METHOD: Twenty-five patients with severe carotid stenosis were examined on their cognitive function by RBANS (Japanese version), WAIS-R (Japanese version), and NART (Japanese version) before treatment of carotid revascularization (endarterectomy or stenting). They had full activities of daily living without any hemiparesis, aphasia, agnosia, and apraxia at the time of the examinations. RESULTS: Mean intelligent quotient (IQ) measured by WAIS-R and NART was 104.0 +/- 10.7 and 101.3 +/- 13.4, (ns) respectively. Mean total scale of RBANS was 90.0 +/- 13.4, which was significantly lower than both the results of WAIS-R and NART. A mean value of each RBANS index was 91.3 +/- 11.7 in immediate memory, 102.0 +/- 18.2 in visuospatial/constructional, 93.2 +/- 8.7 in language, 84.6 +/- 14.7 in attention, and 92.1 +/- 14.4 in delayed memory. RBANS index significantly declined in immediate memory, language, attention and delayed memory than visuospatial/constructional. CONCLUSIONS: Qualitative evaluation was available in RBANS, WAIS-R, and NART, which enabled the investigators to make a precise comparison between these methods. WAIS-R and NART showed a comparatively preserved function and were presumed to be useful for the evaluation of the baseline of cognitive function in preoperative patients. RBANS demonstrated a slight decrease in memory and attention in those patients and was expected to be useful to detect the cognitive dysfunction when compared with WAIS-R and NART.},

   abstract = {UNLABELLED: Cognitive intraindividual variability (IIV), or dispersion, has been associated with pathological changes, including cognitive and functional decline. Dispersion is typically assessed with experimental cognitive measures or subtests selected from several batteries, and few studies have examined IIV from a single neuropsychological battery. METHOD: To address this gap, the current study examined the relationship between the Repeatable Battery for the Assessment of Neuropsychological Status (RBANS) IIV, mean cognitive performance, self-reported functioning, and death among 699 individuals between 64 and 94 years of age who were screened for neurological illness and living independently in the community. A coefficient of variation statistic served as the dispersion index and was derived by calculating the within-subject variability of the five RBANS indexes for each participant and dividing this value by the overall test battery mean. RESULTS: Results revealed that increased dispersion and poorer mean performance simultaneously predicted self-reported memory problems. In addition, participants with elevated dispersion at baseline had increased rates of death nine years later, although this lost significance after controlling for comorbid heart disease. Cluster analysis of the higher dispersion scores revealed four distinct profile patterns that did not differ on the outcome variables. CONCLUSIONS: Elevated RBANS dispersion is a proxy of co-occurring health problems and may be a useful metric of functional decline and death within community-dwelling geriatric populations.},

Dropout rates, onset of medical pathology, and self-reported functioning were tracked at each evaluation. Results confirmed that cluster scores were generally stable over time although the Low Immediate Memory group's Immediate Memory index score regressed upward toward the mean by the third assessment. Of interest, individuals in the Below Average group had substantial dropout between the first and third assessments. Results are interpreted through a clinical framework to explore how RBANS cluster profiles may have predictive value in general neurocognitive functioning over the observed time period and be potentially influenced by general health factors.},

Twenty-one BDD participants were compared with 19 obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) participants and 21 healthy controls (HC), who were age-, sex-, and IQ-matched. Results indicated the BDD and OCD groups demonstrated poor overall neuropsychological performance (i.e. total RBANS) as well as deficits on the indices of Immediate Memory and Attention. Further group differences involving the subtests of Story Memory, Digit Span, and Story Recall were detected. Neuropsychological impairment in BDD with indicated similarities in OCD were corroborated.

Given the cost of assessing and treating incompetence, it is recommended that clinicians develop efficient methods to identify individuals who are most likely to require intensive competence-related treatment interventions. This study sought to ascertain whether a brief cognitive screening instrument, the Repeatable Battery for the Assessment of Neuropsychological Status (RBANS), could predict the length of stay required to restore trial competency among 288 forensic psychiatric inpatients undergoing competency restoration treatment. Results indicated that incompetent defendants who were older or demonstrated poorer overall RBANS performance required longer hospitalizations to be deemed restored to trial competence. Interestingly, incompetent defendants scoring in the 51-60 range on the RBANS Total Scale Index were almost three times more likely to require hospitalization beyond the average length of stay.

   abstract = {OBJECTIVE: There is a broad need for a rapid and efficient neurocognitive battery to detect cognitive decline and differentiate MCI (mild cognitive impairment) and mild dementia from cognitively intact elders. The purpose of this study is to create a version of the repeatable battery for the assessment of neuropsychological status (RBANS) for the Greek population. METHOD: One hundred and sixty-three (163) adults, including healthy controls (HC), MCI and patients with mild dementia, irrespective etiology, were recruited from the day centers of Greek Alzheimer Association after having followed the diagnostic procedure set by the DSM V. The three groups of our sample were matched for age, gender, and education. RESULTS: The Greek RBANS had satisfactory internal reliability, as it yielded the satisfactory coefficient of 0.914. According to the criterion validity, the sensitivity of the RBANS Total score to discriminate controls from patients with mild dementia was 0.94, whereas the specificity was 0.97. In addition, RBANS was also able to discriminate HC from MCI population (sensitivity = 0.87, specificity = 0.81) and MCI from patients with mild dementia (sensitivity = 0.91, specificity = 0.97). CONCLUSIONS: The current data suggest that the Greek version of RBANS is both a valid and reliable psychometric tool, as well as sensitive for detecting cognitive impairment in MCI and early dementia, irrespective etiology. Therefore, taken into account that it revealed coherence in discriminating HC from clinical population, it should be utilized as a neuropsychological screening battery in Greek elders in clinical practice, and also in research protocols.},

   abstract = {The Repeatable Battery for the Assessment of Neuropsychological Status (RBANS; Randolph, 1998 , 2012 ) is a brief neurocognitive instrument used to evaluate cognitive functioning in clinical settings. Prior investigations of the factor structure have revealed subtle differences across samples. It was hypothesized that these differences are primarily the result of methodological decisions made by researchers. The present study utilized empirically supported extraction criteria (parallel analysis; minimum average partial procedure) and uniformly investigated 5 samples. RBANS data from 4 previously published studies (Carlozzi, Horner, Yang, & Tilley, 2008 ; Duff, Hobson, Beglinger, & O'Bryant, 2010 ; Duff et al., 2006 ; Wilde, 2006 ) were reanalyzed, and a new clinical sample was obtained from the Gundersen Health System Memory Center. The congruence of factor structures was investigated by conducting orthogonal vector matrix comparisons (Barrett, 2005 ), and a robust 2-factor structure reliably emerged across samples. The invariant RBANS 2-factor structure primarily emphasized memory and visuospatial functioning. This finding offered further support for a 2-factor RBANS structure identified in previous studies and additionally provided empirical documentation of replication across diverse samples. Due to the expansive use of the RBANS, this psychometric knowledge has significant clinical implications. It should facilitate accurate interpretation of test data and allow clinicians to make more informed decisions regarding whether the instrument is appropriate to use in various clinical settings.},

   abstract = {Although the Repeatable Battery for the Assessment of Neuropsychological Status (RBANS) is a widely studied and utilized screening measure with an Effort Index (EI), there is a minimal amount of data available regarding the utility of the EI for forensic inpatients. Specific concerns include the possibility that the published cutoffs would result in high false positive rates. The present study investigated this issue by comparing the validity of the RBANS EI with that of the Dot Counting Test (DCT) and Test of Memory Malingering (TOMM) in a forensic psychiatric setting (N = 117). Analyses indicated a positive association between RBANS EI categorizations (invalid or genuine responding) and the classifications made by the DCT and the TOMM. However, the false positive rate for the RBANS EI was found to be excessively high (17.95%), while the positive predictive value was below chance (44.74%). Additional psychometric properties for the RBANS EI in this population are reported in the article, including findings from a Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) analysis. Overall, the results suggest that caution is warranted, when utilizing the RBANS EI as a validity measure within a forensic inpatient psychiatric setting and more appropriate cutoffs are needed for this population.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Cognitive deficits are observed throughout all developmental phases of psychosis. However, prior studies have usually focused on a limited illness period and used a wide variety of cognitive instruments. Therefore, it has been difficult to characterize or highlight cognitive functioning in different stages of psychosis. METHOD: We administered the RBANS (Repeatable Battery for the Assessment of Neuropsychological Status) tests to 4 participant subgroups, including healthy volunteers (controls, HC, n = 28), subjects at high risk for clinical psychosis (prodrome, CHR, n = 27), first-episode schizophrenia patients (FE-Sz, n = 26), and mid-term and long-term chronic schizophrenia patients (Ch-Sz, n =147). Comparison, correlation, and regression analyses of RBANS index scores were assessed among groups. We examined clinical outcomes over 2 years between the CHR and HC subjects, and RBANS domains were used as possible predictors for conversion to psychosis. RESULTS: Performance on all RBANS domains was significantly impaired during a post-onset stage of psychosis (FE-Sz and Ch-Sz), and RBANS scores declined along with disease progression. Regression analyses showed that for CHR and HC subjects, baseline impairment in delayed memory (DM) significantly predicted conversion to psychosis. Additionally, partial correlations showed that for FE-Sz and Ch-Sz subjects, DM was the only correlate with a later stage of psychosis. CONCLUSIONS: Cognitive deficits broadly emerged, and diminished functioning followed along with disease progression. Impairment in DM is perhaps one domain that helps us understand the development of psychosis. A critical need is to monitor and treat memory functioning for psychotic patients throughout all phases of the disease.},

   abstract = {Schizophrenia is associated with an increased risk of metabolic syndrome (MetS), which is an important risk factor for developing cognitive impairment in the general population. A few case-control studies have explored the relationship between MetS and cognitive deficits in individuals with schizophrenia but with inconsistent findings. This meta-analysis of case-control studies was carried out to explore the association between MetS and cognitive performance in patients with schizophrenia. Only case-control studies assessing the association of cognitive function and MetS in patients with schizophrenia were identified. Cognitive function was assessed using the Repeatable Battery for the Assessment of Neuropsychological Status (RBANS) scale. Six case-control studies (n = 992) comparing cognition between patients with schizophrenia with MetS (n = 426) and those without MetS (n = 566) using the RBANS were identified. Compared to patients with schizophrenia without MetS, patients with schizophrenia and MetS had significantly more impairments in RBANS total scores [standardized mean difference (SMD) = -0.26, 95% confidence interval (CI): -0.51 to -0.02; I(2) = 72%; p = 0.03], immediate memory (SMD = -0.32, 95% CI: -0.54 to -0.10; I(2) = 66%; p = 0.005), attention (SMD = -0.29, 95% CI: -0.56 to -0.02; I(2) = 77%; p = 0.03), and delayed memory (SMD = -0.24, 95% CI: -0.46 to -0.03; I(2) = 64%; p = 0.03). No group difference was found regarding visuospatial skills and language (p > 0.05). This meta-analysis found that schizophrenia patients with MetS had worse performance on certain cognitive tasks than non-MetS patients.},
